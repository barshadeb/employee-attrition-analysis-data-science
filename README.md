Used open source Kaggle dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pavansubhasht/ibm-hr-analytics-attrition-dataset

- Using Machine Learning and Power BI, explored 30,000 transactions from 1996-2019 to uncover
insights. Fraud most often occurs around mid-day, online, and ranges in low amounts of $0-250.
- From the larger dataset with 24 million normal transactions, under-sampled to a total of 60,000
transactions to eliminate class imbalance for bias in training. Trained various machine learning
models.
