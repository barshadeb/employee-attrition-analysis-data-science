Used open source Kaggle dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pavansubhasht/ibm-hr-analytics-attrition-dataset

Analysed employee attrition trends using the IBM HR dataset using Python. And built an interactive Power BI dashboard to explore factors influencing employee departures.

- Estimated attrition through Predictive Modelling showed a massive class imbalance with 237 people who left and 1233 who stayed.
- Used Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Artificial Neural Networks to predict attrition and develop retention strategies.
- Achieved ~70% Precision on predicting Attrition with Logistic Regression.Â 
- Conducted EDA and visualised data trends using Kernel Density Estimate (KDE) plots, Boxplots and Countplots.

Key findings:
- Sales employees are most likely to leave due to low salaries.
- Frequent manager changes raise attrition risk.
